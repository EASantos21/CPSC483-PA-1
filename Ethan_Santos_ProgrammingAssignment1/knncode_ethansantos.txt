Title: Programming Assignment 1
Name: Ethan Santos
Course: CPSC 483

Goals of this Assignment 
    - Implement a K-Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm from scratch
    - Use the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm offered by Scikit learn to compare the results
    - Identify dependent and independent variables
    - Split the data into train and test sets

Files 
    - knncode_ethansantos.py
        ~ Impelments a KNN model from scratch 
    - knncode_ethansantos.ipynb
        ~ Understanding more about HappinessData-1.csv as well as data preprocessing 
    - knncode_scikit.py
        ~ Implements a KNN model 

Methods
    - I made two separate files to implement a KNN Model
    by scratch and through the scikit library offered
    - I used Jupyter Notebook to better understand the data 
    as well as find what I was looking for in terms of identifying
    variables, splitting the dataset, and getting used to preprocessing data 

Results 
    - The KNN Model from scratch yielded around:
        ~ 50%-60% accuracy at k = 5, k = 7, k = 11
        ~ Many of the results in accuracy weren't consistent, going all over the place
        with some even going up to 80%
    - The KNN Model made with Scikit yielded around:
        ~ 75%-90% accuracy at k = 5
        ~ 80%-90% accuracy at k = 7, k = 11
    - Unfortunately, I was unable to implement code which could visualize
    Error Rate vs. K Value
